      <h3>Into The Crops</h3>
      <hr>

      <p>
        During this project I implemented core gameplay systems such as collision detection and response,
        AI behaviours, and audio systems. I configured the build system for multi-platform targets
        and optimized several systems for smoother performance on Windows and Linux.
      </p>

      <ul class="modal-bullets">
        <li>Developed core gameplay mechanics using C++ and Lua.</li>
        <li>Created debugging and workflow tools to improve team efficiency.</li>
        <li>Implemented sound integration and audio systems using FMOD.</li>
