# AI Demo Project Documentation

## Overview
This demo showcases the implementation of artificial intelligence techniques in video game development. It highlights various AI behaviors and decision-making processes that can be utilized in games.

## Features
- **Pathfinding**: Demonstrates how characters navigate through a game environment using algorithms like A*.
- **State Machines**: Shows how AI can switch between different states (e.g., idle, attacking, fleeing) based on game conditions.
- **Behavior Trees**: Illustrates the use of behavior trees for complex AI decision-making.
